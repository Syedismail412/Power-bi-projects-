The final dashboard design, as shown in the screenshot, is optimized for real-time monitoring and actionable insights.

🧰 Tools & Technology

Platform: Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Data Modeling: Star Schema/Snowflake Optimization

Language: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for creating complex measures and time-intelligence calculations.

🧾 Dataset

The analysis uses a structured sales dataset containing transactional details, focusing on these key dimensions:

Sales Metrics: Total Sales Amount, Boxes Shipped.

Dimensions: Date, Country, Product, Sales Person.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is structured around an executive summary page, providing instant visibility into key performance areas:

Sales KPIs Header: A clear, modern header showcasing essential metrics such as Total Sales Amount, Total Boxes Shipped, and Profit Margin (inferred).

Product Performance (Left): Visuals dedicated to assessing which products are driving revenue and volume.

Sales by Product: Identifying the top-selling and underperforming items.

Sales Distribution by Country (Center): A Map Visual is used to show sales concentration geographically, allowing for quick targeting of regional strategies.

Trend Analysis (Bottom): Time-series charts to observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) or Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) sales progression and identify seasonality or growth slowdowns.

Interactive Slicers: Prominent slicers allow the user to instantly filter the entire dashboard by Sales Person and Date Range.

📌 Key Analysis & Insights

The core focus of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of the business mechanics:

Geographic Focus: Quickly determine top-performing markets and those requiring increased sales investment.

Product Optimization: Identify high-margin products versus high-volume products to guide pricing and inventory strategy.

Sales Team Effectiveness: Use the Sales Person slicer to evaluate individual contribution and manage performance.
