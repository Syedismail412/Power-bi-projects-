Project-2: Power BI Sales and Customer Analytics Dashboard

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on advanced business intelligence using Power BI to deliver a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and product contribution. It transforms the raw sales dataset into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that goes beyond simple totals to uncover hidden patterns and inform strategic decisions regarding inventory, marketing, and customer retention.

The final dashboard design, as shown in the screenshot, is optimized for real-time monitoring and actionable insights.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technology

Platform: Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Data Modeling: Star Schema/Snowflake Optimization

Language: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for creating complex measures and time-intelligence calculations.

ðŸ§¾ Dataset

The analysis uses a structured sales dataset containing transactional details, focusing on these key dimensions:

Sales Metrics: Total Sales Amount, Boxes Shipped.

Dimensions: Date, Country, Product, Sales Person.

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is structured around an executive summary page, providing instant visibility into key performance areas:

Sales KPIs Header: A clear, modern header showcasing essential metrics such as Total Sales Amount, Total Boxes Shipped, and Profit Margin (inferred).

Product Performance (Left): Visuals dedicated to assessing which products are driving revenue and volume.

Sales by Product: Identifying the top-selling and underperforming items.

Sales Distribution by Country (Center): A Map Visual is used to show sales concentration geographically, allowing for quick targeting of regional strategies.

Trend Analysis (Bottom): Time-series charts to observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) or Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) sales progression and identify seasonality or growth slowdowns.

Interactive Slicers: Prominent slicers allow the user to instantly filter the entire dashboard by Sales Person and Date Range.

ðŸ“Œ Key Analysis & Insights

The core focus of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of the business mechanics:

Geographic Focus: Quickly determine top-performing markets and those requiring increased sales investment.

Product Optimization: Identify high-margin products versus high-volume products to guide pricing and inventory strategy.

Sales Team Effectiveness: Use the Sales Person slicer to evaluate individual contribution and manage performance.

Trend Identification: Spot historical patterns in sales to forecast future demand more accurately.
